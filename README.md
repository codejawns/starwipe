## Background

What is **starwipe**? _Why_ is **starwipe**?

![David from Schitt’s Creek: What? Why?](dist/images/david-why.gif)

A few years ago, while I was completing my master's degree, I finally told my imposter syndrome to eff off, and I started submitting proposals to conferences. Whelp, now I've spoken at some! Then I found myself using the same base over and over and over again to create each presentation, and thought, "there's got to be a better way!"

So I decided to build something that could reuse similar assets while still incorporating the slideshow library. Now there is **starwipe**, which I want to share with you.

## Features

![David from Schitt’s Creek: It’s an environment.](dist/images/david-environment.gif)

✅ webpages built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)  
✅ slideshow functionality from [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)  
✅ multiple presentations under a single directory  
✅ accessible color combinations  
✅ customizable presentation themes  
✅ Nunjucks for writing templates  
✅ Markdown for writing slides  
✅ shortcodes for including images  
✅ GitHub Pages-ready  

## Quick start

We got this! Let's go through everything a little bit at a time.

![David from Schitt’s Creek: I know. It’s a lot to process.](dist/images/david-process.gif)

### Project requirements

**starwipe** assumes you already have **Node** and **npm** installed. If you do not, follow instructions for [downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Installation

Here's the rundown of what you are going to do.

1. Navigate to the directory where you store your web projects.
1. Next, clone this repository.
1. Go to the newly created **starwipe** directory.
1. Install **starwipe** in the project root directory.
1. Lastly, compile _everything_.

For example, if you store your web projects in a `websites` folder in your home directory, you'd run the following commands in your terminal:

```
% cd websites
% git clone git@github.com:code-jawns/starwipe.git
% cd starwipe
% npm install
% npm run build
```

Once you've done that, you can `npm start` to get your local website up and running!
