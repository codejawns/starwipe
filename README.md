# starswipe

**starswipe** is a small little presentation slideslow. It is built with [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/), and uses [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) for slide functionality.

## Background

A few years ago, I told my imposter syndrome to eff off, and I started submitting proposals to conferences. Whelp, now I've spoken at some! I found myself using the same base to create each presentation, and thought, "there's got to be a better way!" So I decided to build something that could reuse similar assets while still incorporating the slideshow library. Now there is **starswipe**, which I want to share with you.

## Getting started

### Project requirements

**starswipe** assumes you already have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. If you do not, follow instructions for [downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### Installing starswipe

1. Navigate to the directory where you store your web projects.
1. Next, clone this repository.
1. Go to the newly created **starswipe** directory.
1. Install **starswipe** in the project root directory.
1. Lastly, compile _everything_.

For example, if you store your web projects in a `websites` folder in your home directory:

```
% cd websites
% git clone git@github.com:reedcodes/starswipe.git
% cd starswipe
% npm install
% npm run build
```
