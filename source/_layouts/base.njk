  {#-
      The base layout includes head content, such as meta information or CSS
      file references. It is placed in a block so that other layouts that
      inherit this one can add any items that are needed, by including the
      `head` macro and customizing its output. If the inherited layout does
      not include any head content, then this `head()` is used as default.
