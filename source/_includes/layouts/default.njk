  {#-
      There are a few modifications the home layout wants to make to the base
      layout that it is extended; however, it also still wants to use the
      content already _included_ in the `main_content` section, e.g. the page
      title and the call to content. Using `super()` here means we can still
      use that content while also extended what's inside `main_content`.
