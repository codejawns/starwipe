				[Note:]
				Since the Speaker Notes plugin is enabled, the total time of the
				presentation can be set, instead of the timing per slide. Total time
				wins over Default Timing. Timing is calulated in seconds, but we really
				often think of presentation slots in minutes, so this will accept a
				value for minutes, then multiply that by 60 (the number of seconds in
				one minute). The default presentation time is 30 minutes.
